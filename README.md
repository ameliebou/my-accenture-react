This project is my answer to [Accenture](https://www.accenture.com/de-de)'s coding challenge.

## Framework

I decided to use **React** as the main framework of my project. My preferred stack is actually Ruby on Rails, with which I have so far programmed most of my web apps. But as [this coding challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fmkuSsQvLHvr71tKkkC3X6D4WOAbmYm1/view?usp=sharing) was mentionning React, I decided to step out of my comfort zone and give my best with this framework!
